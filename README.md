# Amiga-KiCad-Library
KiCad library files for Commodore Amiga related projects

This project will be managed using guidance from https://opensource.guide/best-practices/ (https://github.com/github/opensource.guide)

Vision: Provide a library for KiCad which provides all of the original Commodore Amiga connectors, integrated circuits, components. Then to expand the library to include symbols for modern Amiga DIY projects such as CPLD/FPGA.

Expectations: For each library file there will be an accompaning md text file. This file will list the part name and any refernces. Refernces or links should be provided for each symbol. This will allow users to access refernce material. Maintainers can verify symbols as well.
